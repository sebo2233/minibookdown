## What is this book?

You may be wondering, why should I read this textbook? Well, we're going to find that answer togrether as we flip through the pages.

This is a textbook about sharing yourself with the world: what traces are we leaving as we pass through? What do we want others to understand about us? What do we want to keep, and what do we want to leave behind?

Enjoy!
